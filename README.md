# NationalCipherChallenge2020
The National Cipher Challenge is an annual cryptographic competition organised by the University of Southampton School of Mathematics. Competitors attempt to break cryptograms published on the competition website. These are my solutions and preparatory programming for the 2020 competition. Note that these solutions may not be used to qualify for any prizes, as per the rules. They are provided for informational purposes only.
